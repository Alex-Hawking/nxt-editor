<p>NXT Editor is a NeXT generation application for editing .txt files. It is packed with clever and interesting features to enhance your experience working with text files.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>NXT Editor is packed with cool and interesting features that increase the usability of the app, the ease of creation of text files and that increase the readability and "cool" (if you call UTF-8 characters cool) factor of your .txt files.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Fonts</h4>
<p>One of the biggest features of NXT Editor is the ability to use "fonts" in your text files.&nbsp;While you can't actually use fonts in .txt files there are a number of UTF-8 characters that can be combined to make "fonts". The ones used in NXT Editor are shown below.</p>

<p>These characters can be copy-pasted pretty much anywhere you can write text, including in .txt files, making them a cool way to write headings, bold or italic text.</p>
<h4>Symbol Insertion</h4>
<p>NXT Editor has a built in library of 120 different characters and symbols which can easily be inserted into your document through the menu or right click.&nbsp;These symbols range from mathematical to WingDings&nbsp;characters to Roman Numerals. Similar to emojis these characters can add personality to your document or they may just be essential to a mathematical equation, they are now available right in your editor. Some examples of these symbols include:</p>

♬
♥

♕

<h4>Ease Of LIfe</h4>
<p>NXT Editor has a number of features that are designed to make life easier for you, the user. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Auto-completion: Typing a character such as a bracket or a quotation mark will automatically add another one to the other side of the caret (cursor). This can be turned off in the menu,</li><li>Auto list indentation: When a line is started with a hyphen ( - ) the editor detects it as being the start of a list. When enter is pressed another hyphen is inserted underneath. The amount of whitespace before the hyphen is also repeated in the new line. This be turned off in the menu.</li><li>Spell check: The editor highlights words that are believed to be spelt incorrectly and underlines them. When right-clicked a number of suggestions are shown, you can also add the word to your dictionary. This can be turned off in the menu.</li></ul>
<h4>Numpad-less Special Characters</h4>
<p>Many people are aware of turning on num-lock, holding the alt key and typing on the keypad will insert a special character. However,&nbsp; many people do not have num pads so NXT Editor has a special feature where holding the alt key and pressing a number from 0-9 will insert a special character into the document.</p>
<p>There are many more features that make NXT Editor unique and I hope you enjoy using them.</p>
